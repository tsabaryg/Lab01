Implement dynamic instruction panel for Meta Quest 3 VR app in Unity with Hebrew support

- Created `InstructionPanel` as a World Space Canvas, positioned 1.5m in front of `OVRCameraRig`'s `CenterEyeAnchor` with height adjustment using `PanelPositioner.cs`.
- Added dynamic content support with `InstructionManager.cs`:
  - Displays text (`TextualInstruction` with TextMeshProUGUI), images (`VisualInstruction` with RawImage), videos (`VideoInstruction` with VideoPlayer and Render Texture), and audio (`VocalInstruction` with AudioSource).
  - Managed content via `Instruction` struct array, with navigation using `NextButton` and `PrevButton`.
- Configured UI with Content Size Fitter and Layout Element for adaptive sizing.
- Ensured components toggle visibility based on content availability (e.g., `imageUI.gameObject.SetActive(instr.image != null)`).
- Added Hebrew text support by importing Noto Sans Hebrew font and enabling RTL in TextMeshProUGUI.
- Tested in Unity and Quest 3 with Passthrough mode; hand tracking not yet implemented.
- Hands control will be added in the next version
